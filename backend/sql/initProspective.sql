    <h1>McGill School of Computer Science</h1>
    
    <p> <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill University</a> is one of the top research universities in Canada and is the only Canadian university to rank consistently among the top 25 universities in the world (based on <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/about/points-pride" target="_blank">Times and QS rankings</a>).  The School of Computer Science currently stands second in Canada for its research funding. Our professors have received most of the <a href="/news/award"> top awards in Computer Science</a>, while our students go on to become top-notch research and industry leaders.  A graduate degree from the McGill School of Computer Science is recognized in both the academic and industrial worlds as a proof of excellence.</p>

                <p> Our department is currently 34 <a href="/people/faculty">faculty members</a> strong, 60 Ph.D. students, and 100 Masters students. All of our Ph.D. students and most of our Masters students are funded through teaching assistantships or research assistantships. Approximately half our graduate students are Canadian and the other half are from abroad.  </p>

                <h2>Location</h2>

                <p>McGill is an English language university located in the heart of Montreal, the second largest French-speaking city in the world.  Montreal has a reputation for its cosmopolitan atmosphere, history, cultural and sport activities, and excellent restaurants. The cultural offerings of the city include a symphony orchestra, ballet, opera, several theaters and museums. For outdoor recreation, Mount Royal, a wooded mountain with a lake and parks located very close to the university, along with the St. Lawrence river, the many lakes and parks around the island of Montreal, provide opportunity for a wide variety of activities. Montreal consistently ranks among the most livable cities in the world, and the cost of living is among the lowest for cities of its size. The city is extremely safe and has an excellent public transportation system. Note that although speaking French is useful to fully enjoy your experience in Montreal, it is by no means necessary, as English is also spoken fluently by most of the population. More information can be found on the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/prospective/" target="_blank">McGill Prospective Students web page</a>, while information on Montreal is available from <a href="http://www.montrealinternational.com/en/vivre/index.aspx" target="_blank">Montreal International</a>.</p>

                <h2> The Academic Year </h2>

                <p>The academic year at McGill, as at most Canadian universities, has two terms (or semesters). These are the Fall term - early September to early December - and the Winter term - early January to mid-April.There is also a Summer term, although no graduate courses are offered during this session. It is used by students as a time for research or completing projects or theses.  </p>

                <h2>Important Information for Foreign Students </h2>

                <p>All students who are not citizens or permanent residents of Canada are required to obtain the necessary Visa and/or Student Authorization documents prior to entering the country. Do NOT leave home without proper documentation! You CANNOT change your status from Visitor to Student when in Canada. </p>

                <p><b>Student Authorization:</b> Issued by Canada Immigration through a Canadian Embassy or Consulate. There is a processing fee of $125 on all applications for Student Authorizations. LINK </p>

                <p><b>Certificate of Acceptance (CAQ):</b> Issued by Quebec Immigration for a fee of $100. If there is no Quebec Immigration office in the country in which you are applying, you must fill out the application for a CAQ and send it to the Quebec Immigration Office in Montreal along with the $100 processing fee. Once CAQ is approved, Quebec Immigration will telex the Canadian Embassy you are dealing with. If there is a Quebec Immigration office in the country in which you are applying, you apply for the CAQ through them.  </p>

                <p><b>Health Insurance (Compulsory):</b> Quebec requires all international students to participate in a recognized Health Insurance Plan. Cost is approximately $500 per year for a single person. Most students use one of the insurance plans offered by McGill.  </p>

                <p>Once accepted, all international students receive detailed instructions on immigration procedures. These instructions should be read very carefully to avoid unnecessary delays. Applicants are advised to begin procedures necessary to ensure admission to Canada and complete required medical papers for Canadian Immicolor"

                </p><h2>Student Accommodation</h2>

                <p>Off-campus housing is the most popular among McGill graduate students, as it is usually affordable, convenient, and easy to find.  The <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/offcampus/" target="_blank">Off-Campus Housing Service</a> keeps a computerized list of available housing within walking distance of McGill, or easily accessible by metro and bus lines. Most listings are checked to ensure minimum standards of cleanliness and state of repair. Rental rates vary according to accommodation desired, but are considered very reasonable in comparison with most North American cities.  The University maintains a limited number of apartment units in several nearby locations. Housing request forms can be obtained from the Graduate Housing office.  </p>

    <h1>CEGEP</h1>
    
    <h2>What You Need To Apply</h2>

<p>If you are completing a science pre-university CEGEP program, you should apply to the B.Sc. programs offered through the Faculty of Science. To be eligible to enter the program of your choice you will need your DEC and to have completed the following CEGEP-level courses: Biology - NYA (00UK); Chemistry - NYA, NYB (00UL, 00UM); Mathematics - NYA, NYB, NYC (00UN, 00UP, 00UQ); Physics - NYA, NYB, NYC (00UR, 00US, 00UT). If this is your case, you should apply though the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science">Faculty of Science</a></p>

<p><b>If you are graduating from the new Math and Computer Science CEGEP program</b>, you should also apply though the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science">Faculty of Science</a>, and select the BSc in the Physical, Earth, Mathematics and Computer Science Group. You will then be able to proceed directly to a major in CS or SE and will not have to complete any extra science courses at McGill.</p>

<p>If you have a different background that includes some mathematics, you can still enter B.A. programs in Computer Science. In this        case you should apply to the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/arts/">Faculty of Arts</a>.</p> 

<p>See the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/applying/admissionsguide/quebec/">official McGill page for CEGEP students</a>.</p>

<p>Note that you do <b>not</b> need to have prior experience with computer science to apply to our programs: you can start with our introductory programming course, COMP 202, Introduction to Computing I.  However, if you have already completed a course in programming, you may be able to start your McGill program directly with the course COMP 250 Introduction to Computer Science</p>

<h2>How You Apply</h2>

<p>For general information on admission, fees, etc., see the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/applying/">McGill admissions web site</a>.  To apply on-line, select "Applying On-line".</p>

<p>You will be asked to create an account, enter your personal information, etc.  Once you reach the page asking your about <b>Program Choice</b>:</p>

<p><b>For students with a science DEC:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>For "Faculty/School/Center", choose "Faculty of Science"</li>
  <li>For "Program", choose "B Sc Physical, Earth, Math &amp; Computer Sci" for all Computer Science or Software Engineering Majors, except for the Joint Computer Science and Biology Major.   If you are specifically interested in the the Joint Computer Science and Biology Major, then choose "B Sc Biological, Biomedical &amp; Life Sci"</li>
  <li>For "Major or Subject", choose one of "Computer Science", "Math &amp; Computer Science", "Physics &amp; Computer Science", "Stats &amp; Computer Science", "Software Engineering" or "Computer Science and Biology".</li>
</ul>

<p>If you decide later you prefer a different major, do not worry as you can declare a different major from within the same group at the time of registration.</p>

<p><b>For students with a non-science DEC and with reasonable background in mathematics</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>For "Faculty/School/Center", choose "Faculty of Arts";</li>
  <li>For "Program", choose "B Arts";</li>
  <li>For "Major or Subject", choose "Undeclared"</li>
</ul>

<p>Students in the Faculty of Arts only declare their major and minor concentrations at the time of registration.  Students interested in Computer Science will select a major concentration called "Computer Science" and they may also add to that another minor concentration called "Supplementary Minor Concentration in Computer Science".  This combination is actually very similar to the B.Sc. major in Computer Science.</p>

    <h1>Freshman Program</h1>
    <p> Academic programs at McGill are normally four-year, 120-credit programs.  In the B.Sc.,  B.A. and B.A.&amp;Sc. degrees, this is split into a 30-credit freshman program and a three-year, 90-credit departmental program. </p>
                <p> Students entering directly from high schools (outside of Quebec) usually start with the 30-credit freshman program, whereas students coming from Quebec CEGEP programs are usually granted 30 credits at the time of admission and they start directly into the 90-credit departmental program. </p>
<p> If you are a CEGEP student, you do not need to read any more about the freshman program, since you will not need to take it. </p>
<p> If you are a high school student, then you will need to consider which courses to take in your freshman year to best prepare you for a Computer Science or Software Engineering Major.</p>
<p>There is a separate freshman program for each degree, as specified at:</p>
<ul> 
  <li> B.Sc. Freshman Program <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science/student/newstudents/u0/bscfreshman/">(SOUSA, B.Sc. Freshman Advice)</a></li>

</ul>
<p> Although each degree (B.Sc., B.A., B.A.&amp;Sc.) has its own freshman requirements, all freshman students interested in continuing on to a Computer Science or Software Engineering major can use the following general guidelines for selecting the computer science part of their freshman programs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In all cases, if you intend to  study Computer Science or Software Engineering,  then you should complete two calculus courses in your freshman year ( <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-139">MATH 139</a> or <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-140">MATH 140</a> or <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-150">MATH 150</a>) and ( <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-141">MATH 141</a> or <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-151">MATH 151</a> ).   For more detailed information on how to choose your calculus courses see the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science/student/newstudents/u0/howto/">SOUSA Website</a>.  </li>
  <li>If you can find room in your freshman year, you should also try to take <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-133">MATH 133</a> and <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/math-202">COMP 202</a>.  If you are unable to do so, you can still follow a Computer Science or Software Engineering major, but you will not be able to proceed to the higher-level courses as quickly.  </li>
  <li>If you already have some programming experience or if you want to get ahead on your computer science curriculum, then you might also consider including <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/comp-250">COMP 250</a> and/or <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2012-2013/courses/comp-206">COMP 206</a> in your freshman year.

    <h1>Choosing a Major</h1>
    
    <p> There are many possible options for studying Computer Science or Software Engineering at McGill.   The School of Computer Science offers many programs, all of which are listed <a href="/academic/undergrad/overview">here</a>.   On this page we provide you with some clear guidance on how to pick the right degree program for you.  If, after reviewing all of the material, you have some specific questions, then ask us for <a href="/about/contacts">some personal advice</a>.  </p>

<h2> Bachelor of Science - B.Sc. (Faculty of Science)</h2> 

<p> Most of our students choose a B.Sc. degree program. The B.Sc.  degree is  suitable for you if: </p>

<ul> 
  <li> you are coming from a high school program outside of Quebec and you have enjoyed both Mathematics and Science; or </li>
  <li> you are coming from any Science CEGEP program from within Quebec.  </li>
</ul>

<p> There are three main programs available in the B.Sc. program: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Major in Computer Science (also available with a Computer Games Option) </li>
  <li> Honours in Computer Science </li>
  <li> Major in Software Engineering </li>
</ul>

<p> The Major in Computer Science contains core required courses, plus a wide choice of higher-level complementary courses.   If you choose this program, you will get a good general background in foundational and applied Computer Science and you will get to choose from a wide variety of complementary courses that you will let you explore some more advanced topics.   With the correct choice of courses you could prepare yourself for employment or for further graduate studies.</p>

<p> The Honours program requires more courses than the Major,  plus there are some core courses which have a special Honours version.  An Honours program gives you a deeper and more comprehensive education in Computer Science.  </p>

<p>The Major in Software Engineering also contains a core of Computer Science courses, but also contains more courses pertaining to the principled development of software. A more detailed explanation of the difference between the Computer Science and Software Engineering majors is given further on. </p>

<p>If you decide on a B.Sc. degree with a Major/Honours in Computer Science or Software Engineering, then you should choose "Faculty of Science" on your application form and choose the Physical, Earth, Math and Computer Sciences group. </p>

<p> Note that there is a lot of flexibility in the B.Sc. programs and you can combine your Computer Science studies with other disciplines by doing a joint degree or by taking a minor in many other fields.  (see <a href="combining"> the Combining Studies page</a>)</p> 

                                

<p>For detailed B.Sc. program information, see the <a href="/academic/undergrad/bsc">Program Listing Page</a>. </p>


<h2> Bachelor of Arts - B.A. (Faculty of Arts) </h2> 

<p> Some students choose to complete a B.A. degree.   In fact, it is possible to get quite a strong training in Computer Science within the B.A. degree program by taking both the Computer Science Major Concentration along with the Supplementary Minor in Computer Science.   In terms of Computer Science content, this is almost the same at the B.Sc. major in Computer Science.  You will be taking the same Computer Science classes and you will work in the same state-of-the-art computer labs as students in the B.Sc. program.  In fact, in the classes and labs there are no distinctions between students in the B.A. program and students in the B.Sc. program - they are equal.</p>

<p>The B.A. degree is suitable for you if your background does not include very much Science,  but you do have a good background in Mathematics and you have an interest and aptitude for logical reasoning.    </p>

<p> If you decide on a B.A. degree, then you should choose "Faculty of Arts" on your application form. </p>

<p> For detailed B.A. program information, see the <a href="/academic/undergrad/ba">Program Listing Page</a>.</p> 

<h2>Bachelor of Arts and Science - B.A.&amp; B.Sc. (Joint program offered by the Faculties of Arts and Science) </h2> 

<p> There is one final possibility, and that is the combined B.A.&amp;Sc.  degree, which is jointly offered by the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Arts.   In the B.A.&amp;Sc degree you can combine a 36-credit Major Concentration in Computer Science or Software Engineering with a Major Concentration or two Minor Concentrations from Arts.   For example, you could combine your a Computer Science studies with areas such Economics, Anthropology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Geography and many other possibilities. With the B.Sc. degree you will learn all about Software Engineering and whatever else interests you.  You will have the opportunity to take a wide range of classes with both foundational and practical applications.   In addition, you can choose your complementary and elective courses to learn more about computer applications or to broaden your studies in Arts, Sciences or Management.  </p>

<p> For students coming from CEGEP, the B.Sc. degree fits into 90 credits and can be completed in three years.  </p>

<p> The B.S.E degree is structured so that in addition to courses specific to Software Engineering,  you must also take many engineering-specific courses that are common to the Engineering degrees, plus more courses related to hardware. For example, students in the B.S.E. program must take required courses such as Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, Circuit Analysis, Fundamentals of Signals and Systems, and so on. Since the Engineering courses require quite a few credits, there is less flexibility for studying more software courses and many fewer electives. The inclusion of all of these extra Engineering courses also means that students must take more total credits. For students coming from CEGEP, the B.S.E. degree is 112-114 credits, meaning that it takes at least 3 1/2 years to complete. Students graduating from this program are eligible for registration as professional engineers, since the program has been accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.</p>

                            <p>Students in both programs have a wide variety of job opportunities and access to internship opportunities. Students in the B.Sc. program have more flexibility to choose their programs and can, for example, select courses that also prepare them for a career in <a href="/academic/undergrad/games">game programming</a> or to study a minor in Management or Marketing.</p>

    <h1>Computer Science and Other Studies</h1>
    
    <p> For many students, combining computer science with another
discipline is a great way to explore a wider range of options.  
This page describes your choices. Links to the detailed programs
can be found <a href="/academic/undergrad/program">here</a>.</p>

<h2>B.Sc. Liberal Program</h2>
<p>
Starting in Fall 2007 McGill introduced a brand new kind of 
B.Sc. program that allows you to combine a Core Science 
Component (CSC) (45 credits) of Computer Science or Software 
Engineering with a Breadth Component (at least 18 credits) of
another discipline. This is a great option for students who wish
to learn about the core part of Computer Science,  but who also
want some breadth, including Arts, Management or other Sciences.
</p>
<p>
The B.Sc. Liberal program lets you create your own combination. 
Here are just some examples: 
</p><ul>
  <li> 
    You might be interested in leaving the option open for 
    future studies in Medicine, Dentistry or other 
    health-related fields. There is a brand new minor 
    program, the Interdisciplinary Life Sciences Minor, 
    which is a great choice. By combining the core of
    Computer Science or Software Engineering with the 
    Interdisciplinary Life Sciences minor you can prepare 
    for many diverse career options.
  </li>
  <li>
    You might also be interested in Arts, so you could 
    combine your CSC in Computer Science with an Arts minor
    or major concentration. There are a large number of 
    options in Arts from minors like Social Sciences of
    Medicine to Philosophy and Anthropology.
  </li> 
  <li> 
    You might be interested in applying your Computer 
    Science knowledge to management,  so you could combine 
    your CSC in Computer Science with a minor in management, 
    finance, marketing or technological entrepreneurship.
  </li> 
  <li>
    You might be interested in applying Computer Science to 
    another Science discipline by completing a minor in 
    Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Psychology, Geography, and 
    so much more.
  </li> 
  <li>
    You also have to option of creating your own breadth 
    component - they key point is to select 18 credits of 
    Science courses that include enough courses outside of 
    your area and enough courses at the 300-level or above.   
    The exact rules for this option will be given in a new
    "General Science Minor".
  </li> 
  <li>
    You might also decide that you prefer to concentrate in 
    another area and choose a CSC in another Science and 
    then use a Minor in Computer Science as your breadth
    requirement. The choice is yours.
  </li> 
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Joint Major (or Honours) in Computer Science and Biology</h2>
<p>
With the advent of new biotechnologies, biology is becoming 
more and more of a quantitative science, with a clear need for 
advanced mathematical and computational approaches to design 
experiments, and manage, store, analyze, and integrate their 
results. This new joint program will give you an in-depth 
understanding of biology, computer science, and how the two are 
irrevocably intertwined. This new breed of multidisciplinary 
scientists will be highly sought after on the job market as well 
as in graduate programs.   Students interested in this joint 
major should apply to the Bio-Physical-Computational Sciences Group. All other Computer Science programs are in the 
Physical, Earth, Math and Computer Sciences Group.
</p>

<h2>Joint Major (or Honours) in Mathematics and Computer Science</h2>
<p>
Computer science and mathematics are a natural fit. In fact, 
many of the early pioneers of computer science, such as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von
  Neumann</a>, were mathematicians themselves! By combining the two fields,
students develop the rigorous conceptual thinking and problem-solving
abilities that characterise training in mathematics. At the same time,
they are continually challenged by their computer science courses to put
those ideas into practice. Advanced computer science subjects ranging from
machine learning to cryptography to internet searching are often highly
mathematical, so the solid training our joint programs provide are
excellent preparations for graduate school or careers in industry. The
joint honours program is particularly challenging and, therefore,
particularly rewarding. Many of our best students follow this option and
go on to complete PhD s in their choice of computer science or mathematics
at the best universities in the world. They invariably say that their
training in the joint honours program was decisive in their success.

<h2> Joint Major (or Honours) in Physics and Computer Science</h2>
<p>
Computer science and physics are no strangers either. From the invention
of randomized algorithms to study nuclear explosions during the top-secret
Manhattan Project, to the invention of the World Wide Web at the CERN
particle physics laboratory, physicists have been enthusiastic users and
innovators when it comes to computers. As time goes on, large-scale
computer simulations play an ever-increasing role in physics research,
resulting an ever-increasing need for physicists with real training in
computer science. On another front, the world internet speed
record is currently held by scientists working to develop a worldwide
distributed computing system for analyzing the avalanche of data expected
to be generated by the next generation of experiments at that same CERN
that invented the Web. A joint major in computer science and physics
positions students to work as professional physicists, as software
engineers, or somewhere in betsubjects and
a wide range of other Science minors are available including 
Biology, Biotechnology, Earth and
Planetary Sciences and Environment.  You can even broaden your
studies outside of Science and select a minor from Arts.  You 
can choose from a huge list of minor and
major concentrations in Arts including Economics, English Literature, 
Linguistics, Philosophy and many others.  By combining a Computer
Science or Software Engineering major with a minor you can really
build the combined program of your choice!
</p>
<h2>Minor in Computer Science</h2>
<p>
Perhaps your main interests lie outside of Computer Science,  but you
still have an interest in a smaller program in Computer Science.  The
Computer Science minor is a great way to combine some Computer Science
studies with your main interests.  If you end up really liking your
Computer Science classes you can consider switching into the Computer
Science Major program.

<p>

    <h1>Internships</h1>
    
    <p>
Some students would like to gain valuable paid practical experiences during
their degree studies. In Computer Science at McGill there are two good ways to
do this.
</p>
<h1>Internship Year in Science </h1>
<p>The IYS (<i> Internship Year in Science </i>) is a paid 8, 12 or 16 month
internship available to B.Sc. students. It is a career-related, professionally
supervised, paid work term which allows you to experience firsthand the current
practices and technologies in business and industry. If you prefer a shorter
period, there is also an option of completing a 4-month Industrical Practicum.
</p>
<p> The IYS program and the Industrial Practicum courses offer you the chance
to test your career goals, gain confidence and experience and to return to your
studies more focused, with a sense of where your academic careers might lead.
Due to the longer work term, employers tend to assign IYS interns to
significant projects which can be seen through from start to finish.
</p>

<p> If you complete an IYS internship then this will be recognized by adding
the clause "Internship Option" to your degree. So, a degree "Major in
Computer Science" would become "Major in Computer Science - Internship Option".
</p>

<h2>Industrial Practicum </h2>

<p> Some students find an internship rather long, and would prefer a shorter
work experience that might fit into the summer term. The <i>Industrial
Practicum</i> works well for this situation. It is a 4-month work term. If
you complete an Industrial Practicum you will have this recognized by
having a 0-credit course called "Industrial Practicum" added to your
transcript.  </p>
